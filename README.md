Project Description

Cosmic Explorer is an interactive space exploration website that provides information about our solar system, space exploration news, and real-time tracking of the International Space Station. The website features:

Home Page: An animated solar system visualization with cosmic statistics

Planets Page: Detailed information about planets in our solar system with filtering capabilities

Exploration Page: Latest space exploration news from NASA and mission highlights

The design features a dark cosmic theme with animated starfields, interactive elements, and responsive layouts that work across all device sizes.



Custom Requirement Implementation
I implemented a Modal System using ES6 Class that handles planet detail displays. This system includes:

Class-based Architecture: Created a ModalSystem class that encapsulates all modal functionality

Keyboard Support: Added Escape key detection to close the modal

Overlay Click Handling: Modal can be closed by clicking outside the content

Animation Effects: Smooth transitions when opening/closing

Content Management: Dynamic loading of planet information

The modal system is reusable and could be extended for other purposes throughout the application. It demonstrates clean object-oriented JavaScript principles while providing a polished user experience.
